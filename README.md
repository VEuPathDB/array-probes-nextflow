This workflow will create platforms for microarray technologies from input files including array probe sequences and current genomes and annotation (gff files). This is necessary because genomes can be updates and probes must reflect current knowlege about what genes (or genomic loci) they represent. The workflow will handle both splice (mRNA based) probes and unspliced (genomic) and will create some platform specific files such as Affymetrix CDF files.
